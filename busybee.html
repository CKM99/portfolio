    <h3>What is BusyBee?</h3>


<div class="bee">

  <ul>
    <li>BusyBee is a social media photo-sharing app. What's so different about this app is that everyone has their own calendar with images, scrapbooks, journals, and goals.</li>
    <li>  Gen Z'ers don't like explaining to friends why they can't hang out with them on a particular weekend. This app takes care of all the "annoying or "awkward" conversations about plans. For example, in this app, a user can invite other users out to events with details like "whose coming" and the location of the place. Instead of explaining to a friend that they have to hang out with their other friends on the weekend, users can see it on their own.</li>
    <li>Users who also want  to take "mental health" breaks can easily add to their calendar that they aren't going out on a certain weekend.</li>
    <li>This app does not follow the typical social media photo-sharing apps. This is about raw images and memories, hence why there are absolutely no filters on this app. These are for photos that users would want to post on Instagram, but they know it won't get enough likes. Users can also add scrapbooks and journal logs to their calanders.</li>
    <li>The user can have as many accounts as they please; some calendars can be personal, others can be a gym log to follow, meal preps for the month, and so much more. This app is great for small businesses that want to promote their brand.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>To the right is the initial sketch of the app.  It's a quick brainstorm of the function of the app.</li>
    <li>This covers the home page, profile page, and basic functions of the app.</li>
    <li>This sketch points out the most important points of the app.  The wireframe goes into more detail about each section of BusyBee.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>This is the basic user flow of the app.</li>
      <li>The user flow was created to show the basic flow of the app and how easy it works.</li>
      <li>My main goal creating the app was to keep the user flow to a minimum.  Users don't like to click too much or have to many buttons, it becomes overwhelming.</li>
